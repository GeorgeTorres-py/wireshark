What is Wireshark?: It's a network protocol analyzer that captures and displays packet data traveling over a network.

Common Use Cases: Troubleshooting network issues, analyzing traffic, and inspecting protocols.

Capture Traffic:
Select the Right Interface: Choose the correct network interface for capturing traffic (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).
Start Capturing: Click on the interface and select "Start capturing packets."
Use Capture Filters: To limit the data captured, use capture filters (e.g., tcp, udp, port 80).

Stop the capture when you have enough data.
Save the capture file in a format like .pcap for later analysis.

Use Display Filters: Refine what you see by applying display filters (e.g., http, ip.addr == 192.168.1.1).
Follow Streams: For protocols like HTTP, right-click on a packet and select "Follow" > "TCP Stream" to see the full conversation
